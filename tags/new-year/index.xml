Worked on more things than before - learnt a ton of new things&amp;hellip;
Infrastructure management - I got my hands dirty with something i&amp;rsquo;ve always wondered what it was. Knowing how to organize your infrastructure, sizing, planning, creating new machines, the cloud and yes, Amazon EC2 as well!
Got better at automating software delivery - helped improve processes at work! A tiny little tool that I wrote has run with 0 downtime for the last year!</description></item></channel></rss>
