Its the experience while at the restaurant that makes a person go visiting again. Or swoon about it on social media! Good food is just, &amp;ldquo;so to speak&amp;rdquo;, the icing on the cake!
Thats why I pay you a premium for the experience!
When you forget something as essential as a customer&amp;rsquo;s order, the tastiest of dishes at your establishment takes a back seat over a spoilt evening for the people at the table!</description></item><item><title>I Love Jekyll I Hate Jekyll</title><link>https://cruisemaniac.com/post/i-love-jekyll-i-hate-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2014 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cruisemaniac.com/post/i-love-jekyll-i-hate-jekyll/</guid><description>Bad title for a post but thats how my relationship with the [jekyll][1] static site generator stands.
I love it:
It just lets me blog - no shitty admin console, no extra jazz, just keyboard noise &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; blog post with some very simple magic in between. it serves static html - no wordpress security headaches, no server load problems, instant load times given that i load off an SSD on my [host][2]1.</description></item></channel></rss>
