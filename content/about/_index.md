My Name is Ashwin, known around the internet as cruisemaniac. I am a DevOps, Infra and Cloud engineering leader who likes to help people build, migrate and get going with their technology solutions on major cloud providers like AWS, Azure and GCP. I love working with tech - I run my own DNS and email servers.

#### Work

I work as a Senior DevOps engineer with the Autonomous Robotics Research Center at the [Technology Innovation Institute](https://tii.ae).

#### Books

I'm currently shuttling between [The Manager's Path](https://amazon.in/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Camille Fournier and [Psycho-Cybernetics](https://www.amazon.in/Psycho-Cybernetics-Updated-Expanded-Maxwell-Maltz-ebook/dp/B00SI02BW4/ref=sr_1_1) by Dr. Maxwell Maltz.

#### Community

I hang out a lot around twitter and a few slack groups, the most notable being [Remote Indians](https://remoteindian.com/). Its an awesome community and you should join in! I'm an [AWS Community builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/?intClick=dev-center-2021_main) for the Containers category and a User group leader for the [Abu Dhabi AWS User Group](https://www.meetup.com/abu-dhabi-aws-user-group/).

I run a Masterclass to help Engineering teams scale up on Serverless tech with AWS Fargate. Check out and sign up for my [Fargate Masterclass](https://fargate.cruisemaniac.com).

#### Photography

I first saw a DSLR being used by a person who wasnt an event / wedding photographer back in 2006. Since then, I've always wanted to have one but never figured out what it meant to capture a moment. When I turned 40 last year, I decided to just chuck it and get myself a good camera. Something that I'd love carrying around town, click pictures and over the past three months, this hobby has become a form of therapy for me. I also thought as I build my collection of photos, I'd share a few. So [here](https://clicks.cruisemaniac.com) goes...
