## Hi there!

My Name is Ashwin, known around the internet as cruisemaniac. I am a DevOps, Infra and Cloud engineering expert who likes to help people build, migrate and get going with their technology solutions on major cloud providers like AWS, Azure and GCP. I love working with tech - I run my own DNS and email servers.

I'd love to say hi!

## Work

I work as a Lead Infra and Ops Engineer at **[Verloop](https://verloop.io)**. We make amazing Chat bots for customer support. I dabble with kubernetes on GCP and Azure here running systems built on golang, javascript and python.

## Books

I'm currently shuttling between [The Manager's Path](amazon.in/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Camille Fournier and [Psycho-Cybernetics](https://www.amazon.in/Psycho-Cybernetics-Updated-Expanded-Maxwell-Maltz-ebook/dp/B00SI02BW4/ref=sr_1_1) by Dr. Maxwell Maltz.

## Community

I hang out a lot around twitter and a few slack groups, the most notable being [Remote Indians](https://remoteindian.com/) and [Devs and Hackers](http://devup.in/).

## Social Media

I'm not active on facebook. I am fairly active on twitter, you can see the link to it at the bottom of this page, or you can view my github profile to see if there's any repo's I've starred that you might like. I've also got my linkedin profile down there so we can connect!
