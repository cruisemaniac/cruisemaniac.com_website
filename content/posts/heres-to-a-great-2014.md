2013 is done. Its time now for another chance at life - Another new start!

Another attempt to correct the wrongs, move ahead, make new mistakes, learn new lessons, forge new friendships, remember the old ones, call it what you may in this list here - its just another chance to be a new you!

Or, you can just [KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON][1].

Choose whatever but this is how it must play out:

> Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair! - The Joker.

Here's wishing every single one of you the very best in 2014!
